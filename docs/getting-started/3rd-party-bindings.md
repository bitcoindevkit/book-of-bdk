# 3rd Party Bindings

Some organizations are maintaining their own wrappers and language bindings around the BDK libraries. While these are not maintained by the Foundation, they have users in production and are worth looking into!

Note: The bdk-wasm lib can be used in just about any modern JavaScript environment, including Browser, Node, ReactNative, etc.


## Flutter

## ReactNative
