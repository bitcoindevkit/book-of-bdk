# BDK CLI

### Purpose

The `bdk-cli` binary crate is designed as an experimental playground for users to dive into the `BDK` libraries with ease. 

Its documentation is available [here](https://docs.rs/crate/bdk-cli/latest), and you can explore the source code [here](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli).

### Features

`bdk-cli` can be compiled with different features to suit your experimental needs.

##### Database Options

- `sqlite`: Sets the wallet database to a sqlite3 db. `sqlite` is a default feature.

##### Blockchain Options

- `rpc`: Connects the wallet to bitcoin core via RPC.
- `electrum`: Connects the wallet to an electrum server.
- `esplora`: Connects the wallet to an esplora server.
- `cbf`: Connects the wallet to kyoto - a node and client for compact block filter based syncing.
    
##### Extra Utility Tools

- `repl`: use bdk-cli as a REPL shell (useful for quick manual testing of wallet operations).
`repl` is also a default feature.
- `compiler`: opens up bdk-cli policy compiler commands.
- `verify`: uses bitcoinconsensus to verify transactions at every sync call of the wallet.

These features are non-exhaustive as more features will be added.

### Installation

You have the option to build `bdk-cli` from its source code or install directly from `crates.io`.

To build from the [source](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli):

``` 
    cd <bdk-cli git repo directory>

    cargo install --path . --features electrum

    bdk-cli help # to verify it worked
```

To install from `crates.io`, run this command:

```
cargo install bdk-cli --features electrum  # add any additional features as needed
```

Note that if no blockchain client feature is enabled, online wallet commands will be disabled.

### Usage

To get usage information for the bdk-cli binary use the below command which returns a list of available wallet options and commands:

```
cargo run
```

Follow the instruction in [descriptors](../cookbook/keys-descriptors/descriptors.md) to generate descriptors, selecting your preferred network and descriptor type.

Assuming you exported your external and internal descriptors as `EXT_DESC` and `INT_DESC`, we can generate a new address by running the following command:

```
cargo run -- --network [selected network] wallet -e $EXT_DESC -i $INT_DESC -d sqlite new_address
```

To sync the above wallet to a Bitcoin Core node (assuming a regtest node at 127.0.0.1:18443, username and password of bitcoin:bitcoin), run the following command:

```
cargo run --features rpc wallet -e $EXT_DESC -i $INT_DESC -d sqlite -c rpc -u 127.0.0.1:18443 -a bitcoin:bitcoin sync
```

To generate a new extended master key, suitable for use in a descriptor:

cargo run -- key generate
