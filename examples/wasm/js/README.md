Server app to test a bdk-wasm package

works when next to (in same parent folder as) copy of https://github.com/darioAnongba/bdk-wasm built successfully

to build successfully on mac required installing llvm with homebrew (even though there's a default version) https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/1671#issuecomment-2456858895
